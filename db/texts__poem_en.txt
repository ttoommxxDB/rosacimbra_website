Sometimes it takes very little
To make the world a beautiful place to be
A smile, a hug, a phone call
Or an object created by you, with your hands
A small gift of beauty
Where creativity meets passion
Here, this is my world!
My happy island, my precious refuge
From which come dresses, bags, socks, overalls...
And where my dolls have a home and a name!
