Sometimes, it doesn’t take much
To make the world a beautiful place
A smile, a hug, a phone call
Or an object crafted by your hands
A small gift of beauty
Where creativity meets passion
This is my world!
My happy island, my precious haven
From which emerge dresses, bags, socks, overalls…
And where my dolls have a home and a name!
